# Part 1: Draw a Diamond
# ==============================
# not much to explain here, straightforward with each part. the first part is basically ensuring user inputs a positive odd number or else the diamond can't run
# the next parts initially i had the diamond filled and not empty, but had to switch it and make the diamond empty
